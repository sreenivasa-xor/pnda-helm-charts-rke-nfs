    "# SparkR tutorial Notebook\n",
    "This is a notebook version of the [SparkR Documentation](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.0/sparkr.html)\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "SparkR is an R package that provides a light-weight frontend to use Apache Spark from R. In Spark 2.4.0, SparkR provides a distributed data frame implementation that supports operations like selection, filtering, aggregation etc. (similar to R data frames, dplyr) but on large datasets. SparkR also supports distributed machine learning using MLlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SparkDataFrame\n",
    "A SparkDataFrame is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns. It is conceptually equivalent to a table in a relational database or a data frame in R, but with richer optimizations under the hood. SparkDataFrames can be constructed from a wide array of sources such as: structured data files, tables in Hive, external databases, or existing local R data frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the examples on this page use sample data included in R or the Spark distribution and can be run using the ./bin/sparkR shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting Up: SparkSession\n",
    "You can start SparkR from Jupyter R Kernel. You can connect your R program to a Spark cluster from RStudio, R shell, Rscript or other R IDEs. To start, make sure SPARK_HOME is set in environment (you can check Sys.getenv), load the SparkR package, and call sparkR.session as below. It will check for the Spark installation, and, if not found, it will be downloaded and cached automatically. Alternatively, you can also run install.spark manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to calling sparkR.session, you could also specify certain Spark driver properties. Normally these Application properties and Runtime Environment cannot be set programmatically, as the driver JVM process would have been started, in this case SparkR takes care of this for you. To set them, pass them as you would other configuration properties in the sparkConfig argument to sparkR.session()."

SparkR supports reading JSON, CSV and Parquet files natively, and through packages available from sources like Third Party Projects, you can find data source connectors for popular file formats like Avro. These packages can either be added by specifying --packages with spark-submit or sparkR commands, or if initializing SparkSession with sparkPackages parameter when in an interactive R shell or from RStudio."
